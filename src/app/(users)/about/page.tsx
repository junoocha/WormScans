          About WormScans
        </h1>

        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          WormScans started as one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just automate this real quick‚Äù
          projects‚Ä¶ and then spiraled into a full-blown manga/manhwa chapter
          scraping and organizing machine.
        </p>

        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Instead of painfully downloading chapters one at a time like it‚Äôs
          2008, WormScans swoops in, grabs the images, sorts them neatly, and
          ships them off to a database, like a polite little worm librarian that
          doesn‚Äôt judge your reading habits.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            Sneaks through supported reading sites using a headless browser to
            grab chapter images. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
          </li>
          <li>
            Auto-organizes everything by series and chapter, because chaos is
            for cliffhangers, not folders.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lets you trim, delete, and upload chapters through a clean UI, no
            Photoshop rage required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stores it all in a central Supabase database, ready to be served to
            your reader app like a well-plated meal.
